xHARPY
======

**xHARPY** (x-ray diffraction Hirshfeld Atom Refinement in Python) is a Python
library that enables refinement with custom atomic form factor calculations.
Current implemented and tested sources for atomic form factors are Hirshfeld 
Atom Refinement from periodic DFT calculations and the independent atom Model
